# How to contribute

Thank you for wanting to be a contributor!

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to GameOfLife](https://github.com/bluekeybo/GameOfLife) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`)
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them
  * Please follow [this](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/c_style_guide.html) coding style by Caltech professor Mike Vanier as close as possible
  
Thank you!
